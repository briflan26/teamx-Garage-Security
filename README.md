# TeamX Garage Security
For our ECE 2305 (Intro to Communications and Networks) course at WPI, we created a prototype garage security system. The system revolves around three main component: 
        1. HTTP Webserver
        2. IOT Garage Door Opener
        3. IOT Security Camera
        
These three components were integrated using the code in this repository, where the backend and static directories contain code for the HTTP Webserver, the garagecam directory contains code for the IOT Security Camera, and the garage-opener directory contains code for the IOT Garage Door Opener.
